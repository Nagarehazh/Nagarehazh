## 🎇 PROJECTS<br/>

### Genisum 🤖
Genisum is an impressive application using ReactJS with Vite for quick and efficient setup. The user interface stands out with its responsive and appealing design, achieved through Tailwind CSS and a touch of glass morphism. With RTK Query, I have made advanced API requests and managed history using local storage. Additionally, the project has an effective form event handling and error capturing, along with the copy-to-clipboard functionality. Throughout the development process, I have prioritized clean code practices, ensuring high-quality development.
